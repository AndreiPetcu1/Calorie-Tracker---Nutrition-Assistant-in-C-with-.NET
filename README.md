# Calorie-Tracker---Nutrition-Assistant-in-C-with-.NET
Calorie Tracker is a desktop application developed in C# using Windows Forms, designed to help users manage their daily caloric intake based on personal data such as age, gender, height, weight, activity level, and
fitness goals. The app calculates both maintenance and target calorie needs using the Strategy Design Pattern, adapting the logic based on the selected goal: weight loss, maintenance, or gain.
Additionally, it provides custom dietary recommendations for Omnivore, Vegetarian, and Vegan preferences. The interface is simple and intuitive, with real-time validation, colored result displays, and a built-in
help menu for user guidance. This project demonstrates good practices in object-oriented programming, user input validation, and clean UI design with modular, maintainable code.
